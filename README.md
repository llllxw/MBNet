# MBNet

# Introduction
MBNet is a multimodal deep learning framework designed to predict whether a compound has a bitter taste.

# Data
compound_info.csv - SMILES (Simplified molecular input line entry system) of compounds.


# Environment Requirement
The code has been tested running under Python 3.7. The required package are as follows:

- pytorch == 2.0.0+cu118  
- numpy == 1.26.0  
- sklearn == 1.0.2  
- networkx == 2.8.4  
- pandas == 1.2.4  
- rdkit == 2023.3.1  
- torch_geometric == 2.3.0
